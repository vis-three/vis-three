## How to Ensure Stable Version Dependencies?

- Use the same version. For example, install version `0.6`, and ensure all related dependencies are set to `^0.6.0`.
- Remove the existing `package-lock.json` file before installing the new version.
- It is also possible that official versions may not be updated in a timely manner, so sometimes manual adjustments are
  needed.
