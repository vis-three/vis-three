# Not Just Three.js

From the previous discussions, we can see that `vis-three` primarily provides a set of development processes and
mechanisms, namely: plugin-based, strategy-based, and configuration-based concepts and mechanisms.

Leaving `three.js` aside, if we only use the concepts and mechanisms of **plugin-based**, **strategy-based**, and *
*configuration-based** frameworks, theoretically, it should be adaptable to any library or framework that requires *
*plugin-based**, **strategy-based**, and **configuration-based** approaches.

So, what sparks might fly when combining with libraries like `Babylon.js`, `d3.js`, and others? We look forward to your
experimentation.
